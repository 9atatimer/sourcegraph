The organization of this folder should contain files and templates that are used to configure a running artifactory appliance.

As this is a module, the file structure should not be organized expecting any particular staging or purpose (ie internal or perimeter use) -- reusability of purpose should be achieved through supplying variables, or supplying data elements that can be expanded into the template file that gets provisioned in the appliance.

If there are general flavors or classes of modules -- in the case of artifactory for the RFC, that would be a perimter repository (DMZ) or an internal repository (GAP).
